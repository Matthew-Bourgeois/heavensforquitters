      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes it takes something drastic to finally get your attention. Most people call it “rock bottom”—that place where you feel like there’s nowhere left to go and no more reason to keep going. That’s where Jesus met me. Not at my best, but at my worst. And that’s where the idea for <strong>Heaven’s for Quitters</strong> was born—out of the journey of crawling out of a dark place and realizing the only way forward was surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
        This brand isn’t about looking perfect. It’s about choosing a new direction—every single day. Each design is a reminder that we’re all fighting something, and that turning away from sin is a battle worth wearing.

      <h2 style="color:#ffd700;">Why I Quit Sin</h2>
      <blockquote style="max-width:700px; margin:auto; font-style:italic;">
        “Even during my time in the military, I leaned on alcohol to get through things I didn’t know how to face. After getting out, I felt completely lost. I chased approval, searched for comfort in all the wrong areas, and numbed my pain with substances. I smiled on the outside, but underneath I struggled with anxiety and a deep sense of unworthiness. I buried it all behind distractions—money, image, and sin—just trying to survive. But eventually, the weight of it all caught up with me. I ended up in a dark place, the kind you never plan on being in. That’s when I finally cried out to God. And He didn’t turn away—He met me right there. Not with judgment, but with grace. It wasn’t an overnight fix. Healing has come one surrendered day at a time. That’s where faith really lives—in those quiet, desperate moments when you keep calling on Him, even when everything in you wants to quit. This shirt is more than fabric. It’s a reminder—for veterans, for anyone struggling—that no matter how far you’ve fallen, God’s hand is still reaching out. I know, because He reached out to me.”

        Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took the punishment we deserved, died the death we earned, and rose again so we could walk in freedom—if we turn from sin and trust in Him.
